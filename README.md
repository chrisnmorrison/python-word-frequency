# Word Frequency in Text Files (Python)

This program prompts the user to enter two values: filename, and number of words (n). If the file exists and is readable, the program returns the top n most common words.

Several sample txt files are included.

### TO-DO

- Improve pattern matching to exclude punctuation (e.g. periods, quotations) from the results.
- Remove filler words (e.g. and, the, to), or provide the user with an option to exclude these words
